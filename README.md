# ETCalculation
This repository starts of with all the old LWSC2002 code on ET calculation with the idea to transform this into a useful set of code for calculation of ET

The Old scripts folder contains the original R scripts from the LWSC2002 unit, there is no guarantee they work.
The Data folder contains some example data that "should" work with the scripts
